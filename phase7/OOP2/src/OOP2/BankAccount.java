 * Create a new class for a bank account.
 * Create fields for the account number, balance, customer name, email and phone number.
 * Create getter and setter for each field. create two additional methods:
 * 1. To allow the customer to deposit funds (this should increment the balance field).
 * 2. To allow the customer to withdraw funds (this should deduct from the balance field).
 * But not allow the withdrawal to complete if there is insufficient bal.
