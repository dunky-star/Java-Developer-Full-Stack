What are Servlets?
- Java class that is processed on the server.
- Java class generates HTML that is returned to browser.
- Can read HTML form data, use cookies and session, etc.
- At a high-level, similar functionality to JSPs.

*** Whenever we write Servlets, we can override a doGet() method or a doPost() method inherited from HttpServlet.
doGet() method has two parameters, they pass on a request object or response object.

@WebServlet("HelloServlets")  ---> is a path for defining where to load servlet from.

BEST PRACTICE
**************
1. Integrate them both together (JSP & Servlets).
   -> Servlet does the business logic.
   -> JSP handles the presentation view.
2. Model-View-Controller (MVC) Design Pattern.   


GET METHOD:
************
1. Very good for debugging.
2. Bookmark or email url.
3. Limitations on data length.

POST METHOD:
************
1. Cannot boomark or email url.
2. No limitations on data length.
3. Can also send binary data.

Recommendation: For non sensitive data, you can use GET method; for sensitive data, POST method is highly to be used.
