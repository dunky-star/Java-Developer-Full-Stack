What are Servlets?
- Java class that is processed on the server.
- Java class generates HTML that is returned to browser.
- Can read HTML form data, use cookies and session, etc.
- At a high-level, similar functionality to JSPs.

*** Whenever we write Servlets, we can override a doGet() method or a doPost() method inherited from HttpServlet.
doGet() method has two parameters, they pass on a request object or response object.

@WebServlet("HelloServlets")  ---> is a path for defining where to load servlet from.

BEST PRACTICE
**************
1. Integrate them both together (JSP & Servlets).
   -> Servlet does the business logic.
   -> JSP handles the presentation view.
2. Model-View-Controller (MVC) Design Pattern.   


GET METHOD:
************
1. Very good for debugging.
2. Bookmark or email url.
3. Limitations on data length.

POST METHOD:
************
1. Cannot boomark or email url.
2. No limitations on data length.
3. Can also send binary data.

Recommendation: For non sensitive data, you can use GET method; for sensitive data, POST method is highly to be used.


[Servlet configuration parameters] is WEB-INF/web-xml file.

How To Redirect from JSP to a Servlet:

You can make use of the method:

    # response.sendRedirect( <thePageUrl> )  - redirects JSP page to Servlet page.
	# Servlet can call JSP using a request dispatcher.
	

MVC Design Pattern with Servlet and JSP.
****************************************
-> Servlet does the business logic.
-> JSP handles the presentation layer.

BENEFIT OF MVC:
***************
1. Minimizes HTML code in Servlet (no more out.println(...) in Servlet code).
2. Minimizes Java Business Logic in JSP (no more large scriplet in JSP).


JDBC:
*******
-> Database Connections in Web apps.
-> Database Connection Pools (Best practice is to use database connection pools - allows your app to scale and handles multiple users quickly).
-> Setting up a Tomcat Database Connection Pool.

STEPS IN SETTING UP JDBC:
**************************
1. Download JDBC driver JAR (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads || https://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/Connector-J/mysql-connector-java-8.0.13.zip).
2. Define Connection Pool in META-INF/context.xml.
3. Get Coonection Pool reference in Java Code.
