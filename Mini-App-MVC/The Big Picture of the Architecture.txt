THE APP ARCHITECTURE:
*********************
1. Web browser submits request to Servlet (Controller) -  student controller.
2. Servlet controller will make use of Helper Class (Model) called [Student DbUtil] to talk to the DB.
3. The data will come back to the controller.
4. Controller will then forward to our JSP page (View).
5. Finally, will send that View back to the browser for the end-user consumption. 

DB Utility (Helper Class): Responsible for interfacing with the database using JDBC code.
-> This is a common design pattern: Data Access Object (DAO).

STEPS:
*******
1. create Student class (Student.java)
2. create Helper class (StudentDBUtil.java)
3. create student controller servlet (StudentControllerServlet.java)
4. create JSP page: list-student.jsp 
5. Replacing JSP Scriptlet codes with JSTL tags.
