THE APP ARCHITECTURE:
*********************
1. Web browser submits request to Servlet (Controller) -  student controller.
2. Servlet controller will make use of Helper Class (Model) called [Student DbUtil] to talk to the DB.
3. The data will come back to the controller.
4. Controller will then forward to our JSP page (View).
5. Finally, will send that View back to the browser for the end-user consumption.
